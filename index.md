| Section | Reflective Questions | Effectiveness (4=very effective, ... 1=not effective) |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **1. Problem Context & Research Question** | - How effective is this report in motivating the research question? <br> - Does it clearly state what is being predicted and why it matters? <br> - Is the framing too general, too narrow, or just right? <br> |       |
| **2. Supervised Models Summary** | - Are the models clearly and concisely presented? <br> - Are key hyperparameters and performance metrics included? <br> - Is there a summary table or structure that helps comparison? <br> |       |
| **3. Model Comparison & Selection** | - Does the report explain *why* the final model was chosen? <br> - Is the reasoning based on more than just test accuracy? <br> - Are challenges like overfitting or tuning addressed? <br> |       |
| **4. Explainability & Interpretation** | - Does the report explain what the model learned and why? <br> - Are SHAP values, feature importances, or coefficients interpreted well? <br> - Are the insights clearly tied to the research question? <br> |       |
| **5. Final Takeaways** | - Does the conclusion summarize the key findings clearly? <br> - Are the takeaways connected to the original question? <br> |       |
| **6. Unsupervised Learning: Context & Method** | - Is it clear why an unsupervised approach is appropriate? <br> - Is the method (e.g., clustering, PCA) well motivated? <br> - What insights were expected from this method? <br>  |       |
| **7. Key Insights from Unsupervised Learning** | - What patterns or clusters were discovered? <br> - Are they clearly described and interpreted? <br> - Are visualizations used to support the findings? <br>  |       |
| **8. Comparison to Supervised Learning** | - Does the report connect unsupervised and supervised findings? <br> - Are consistencies, contradictions, or new insights discussed? <br> - Does it feel integrated or like a separate task? <br>  |       |
| **9. Visuals & Communication** | - Are plots clearly labeled and explained? <br> - Do visuals enhance understanding or feel disconnected? <br> - Are they interpreted in the text? <br> |       |
